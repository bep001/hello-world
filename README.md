## HELLO HELLO

Hi humans!

I am a Korean American Bank Teller who spent half of his life overseas. Thanks to my upbringings, I consider myself a cultural half-breed. 
Simply put, my American colleagues think I am too Korean while Korean colleagues think of me being too Americanized. Back in college I studied Mathematics and Economics. On September 2015, I quitted my old job as an insurance agent in hopes of becoming a Naval Officer with United States Navy. Despite dedicating all my energy and resources, my packet was turned down on April 2016. Here I am, writing some random memoir about me. While I was waiting to hear back from the Navy, I found a part time position with a bank. Initially it looked like a good idea. But now I sometimes think that I may have screwed up early stage of my post college life with couple of inefficient choices.

*Instead of just going for teller, it may have been much better idea for just shoot for banker/loan officer
